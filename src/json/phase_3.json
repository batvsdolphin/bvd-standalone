I had just flown in from &#8230; somewhere and went directly to find my friend Anna at a burger joint in Bushwick. I remember it was snowing pretty hard. We ate, drank a bottle of wine and then went to meet some friends of hers in this tiny, nearly lightless little club nearby. &#8220;Club&#8221; is maybe the wrong word. It was really just a nearby basement with speakers. Anyways, I don&#8217;t know if it was the wine or the moment or the company or the dark, but we danced for hours; we danced until we were dripping with sweat and our legs had all but given out and then kept on dancing.

The blog is <a href=\"http://chutneykid.blogspot.com/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Antonement</strong></p>\n<p><em>&#8220;Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds&#8221;</em><br />\n<em>-Verse 32, Chapter 11 Bhagavad Gita</em></p>\n<p>There stood today, a giant ant, in the center of my bedroom. Mandibles swaying gently in the breeze, it fixed upon me a dark and beady stare. It was almost human in its intensity. This made my decision to kill it even more difficult. I stood, resolute, in my decision. Almost weeping from the emotional strain, I knelt in front of it. I quietly ordered it out. It did not move. I did not want to do this, I said. It was mute in its defiance. I explained that I had a deathly fear of ants crawling into my ear as I slept, and that his death would serve as a cautionary tale for the rest of his ilk. He crawled towards me, insolent in the face of his would-be killer.</p>\n<p>Slowly I stood, and chanted a prayer for his soul. I felt a murderous Lord Krishna, reciting an unholy Bhagavad Gita, to a poor Antjuna. Fearing to look at my victim, I placed a soft floor mat upon his body. I jumped upon it, and, torn between fear, rage and piety, I jumped repeatedly on the mat. Catching my reflection in the mirror, it looked as though I was doing a pagan dance of death upon the grave of mine enemy. Weeping openly now, I flung the floor mat away to pay my respects to the remnants of his brave body. Alas! What was this?! Before my thunderstruck eyes, the ant was alive, and crawled to safetly before my murderous hands could overcome their paralysis. I shrieked and cried as I praised God and his infinite mercy, for he had saved 2 souls this day!</p>\n<p>Such as it is, thoughts and ineffectual actions do have their price. Later that day, I stood in the garden, unbeknownst, next to a red ant nest. As I pirouetted and hopped and danced in the throes of pain (much as I had danced upon the floor mat that very morn), I observed Karma laughing gleefuly at me in the corner.</p>\n"

I took Tintin-time very seriously. As soon as my mother was in the shower or downstairs, I would grab whatever volume we were midway through (Cigars of the Pharaoh and Flight 714 being real favorites), charge in to their bedroom and in to bed with dad, who was already\u00a0reading (and, I expect, <em>enjoying</em>) something else.</p>\n"

I watched Jurassic Park obsessively as a kid and while the velociraptors were clearly my favorite, the one dinosaur that struck fear in my heart was the dilophosaurus. Innocent until its prey (coincidentally, also a chubby programmer like me) came closer, it spread its frills, shrieked, and spit black poison in his eyes. Now imagine if that thing were intelligent. Whatever the personal psychological fears this might reveal, a scheming dilophosaur is objectively terrifying.</p>\n"
