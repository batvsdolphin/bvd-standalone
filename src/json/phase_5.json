Since I couldn&#8217;t go back to sleep after this one, I figured I&#8217;d transcribe the sound of my background anxiety.</p>\n",

They style themselves after Sun Ra and the Arkestra &#8211; a start which was just a wall of sound and chaos. Then you start to pick out the trumpets and the keyboard and suddenly there&#8217;s order. Underneath it all is the drummer playing a little bow on his snare making an unreal uneasy wail. This was my attempt at recreating that sound.</p>\n",

A friend of mine, upon hearing that I had a piano recital this close to adulthood, asked what I was playing. I told her. Turned out she had played the same piece at piano recital .. when she was five. &#8220;Plunk pieces&#8221; she said. &#8220;Gotta love em.&#8221;\u00a0 I remember being a little offended. This goes out to all the plunk pieces, and their plunky players. Even the older ones.</p>\n",
